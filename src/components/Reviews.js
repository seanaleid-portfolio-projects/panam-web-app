                    <BottomTextDescription>This was a staple when I lived in Vienna and when I'm back in town I always visit with my family! Our whole family agrees the pizza is FANTASTIC and honestly better than NY pizza, this is the best pizza in the area. If your meal comes with the salad bar it's great quality and you can tell they don't cheap you out with bad ingredients that aren't fresh.</BottomTextDescription>

                    <BottomTextDescription>Best Gyro I've had in a long, long time, and I have loved Gyros for over 40 years. Wife had chicken parm...cooked to perfection. Spaghetti and marinara sauce were exquisite. Service was very, very friendly. Immediately felt like I was a friend over their house for dinner. Oh, and the cheesecake is to die for--best I've had since my grandmother passed in 1985. My only disappointment is I live an hour away! But I'll still be back!</BottomTextDescription>

                    <BottomTextDescription>It is a rather generous portion, and I basically treat it as a salad.  I will be ordering multiple portions  for takeout when I entertain and supplement it with some wonderful thin toasted baguettes.  It is divine.</BottomTextDescription>

                    <BottomTextDescription>It has that New York style crust that is crunchy outside and soft chewy inside. The sauce is a little sweet and cinnamon-y, just the way I like it.Their gyro platter is huge, enough for two people. Their weekly specials are the epitome of  traditional comfort food, e.g., Chicken Piccata, Chicken Marasala, Lasagna, London Broil... We've been going here at least one month for over a decade now.</BottomTextDescription>
